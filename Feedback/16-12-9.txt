This project is going very well, I'm very impressed. One thing I found jarring was that it runs from the console and then suddenly I get pop up boxes. You don't need to fix this, but something to consider.

I would like it if the user could quit in the middle of a game and not be forced to continue the game.

You don't need to do anything based on this, but I'd like you to think about how easily you could take this program and change it to use a GUI. Is it modularized in such a way that you could simply design the GUI and make use of all of the existing functionality?
