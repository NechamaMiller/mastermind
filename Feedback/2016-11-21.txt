This looks like a very good start. I'll let you decide what direction to go in next, my only requests are that you modify the output so that instead of "numReds" and "numWhites" you give more meaningful feedback like "You have 2 colors correct but in the wrong location", etc. This is the smaller request, the slightly bigger one is that the user be allowed to guess all four colors with one line of text, either with spaces or commas to separate them.
