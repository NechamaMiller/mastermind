This program will simulate a game of Mastermind. The physical game Mastermind entails one player creating a sequence of four different colored pegs, and the other player making logical guesses about that sequence based on feedback from Player 1. 

This program will generate a set of 4 numbers between 1 and 6. It will prompt the user to enter their guess, and will give feedback regarding the accuracy of both the numbers chosen and their placement. 

Possible enhancements will include a multi-player option, different difficulty levels (based on the number of possible numbers), and different amounts of permitted guesses.
