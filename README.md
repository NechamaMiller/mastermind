This program simulates a game of Mastermind. The original game Mastermind entails one player creating a code sequence of four different colored pegs, and the other player making logical guesses about that sequence based on feedback from Player 1. 

This program allows the user(s) to choose from single-player or multi-player game play. If they choose single-player, the computer generates a sequence of 4 colors that will serve as the code; if multi-player, the user who chooses the code enters it. The program then prompts the user who is guessing the code to enter their guess, and gives feedback regarding the accuracy of both the numbers chosen and their placement. 

There are also different levels of game play: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert. They can choose based on the number of colors that are available to be used in the sequence, and the number of guesses they are allowed.

Another option allows for the user to enter the code for the computer to guess.
